Their daughter poisoned the wontons with too much thirteen-spice powder. Her slammed door was filled with disappointment of a failed academic career.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The violent and unwitting man held the hands of the daughter of a wealthy family who had a mistake in her belly. Their only surviving son was a young boy who could drown himself in the world of studies. When he arrived in the city, the limelight blinded his eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I was the fruit of the poisonous tree. The pariah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived in my black robe and with the blade with the dark handle. When I limped into the hallway, hatred filled my prone-to-seizure brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or I stepped onto the stage with my foreign features. The familiar music still haunted my every being. A domestic life with an ordinary woman suited me better than fame and fortune.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or I was the ambidextrous Gokturk princess who became a lesbian before it was cool. The gold fringes and red silk eclipsed that woman’s beauty and my despair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was cursed with an illness too. An ancient illness that plagued the land of pharaohs, Khans, Kings, and Shahs. The dark shamans begged for its arrival. They did a deal with Erlik.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The antidote saved me. Sir William Osler blessed the land with modern medicine. So I was me, finally. Not my obsession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the bloodline ended, at least I could say that I traded the rat race for a moment of happiness. The cursed sadness became my source of strength.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life could’ve been this easy? I wondered. Could I have saved them all? The non-existent ancestral shrine was full of bloodshed. &lt;em>Open your mouths&lt;/em>. I said. &lt;em>Here comes the dopamine&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That was a summer to remember. This was a summer with no assignments and boring extracurricular classes. Zi ran around the whole neighbourhood with her best friend, Ming. A regular summer day included buying a K-pop magazine, finding a spare bench on a public street, and thirsting after the unrealistically-beautiful boy brand member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was 2009. Beijing just recovered from the frenzy of an internationally-proclaimed Olympic Games. Despite the western economic in decline, China was in its hay-day. QQ was filled with propaganda claiming the western media smeared our opening ceremonies through deliberate poor camera skills, and Zhang Yimo’s China was much more glorious. Zi angrily pressed “repost” on all the exposé, cursing the Europeans under her breath. Those negative thoughts didn’t stay with her long, though. Her 20-min internet allowance at grandma’s house was not to be wasted. She frequented internet chat rooms, blocking perverted middle-aged men left and right. Other than that, she prided herself in already reading smuts from K-pop fan-fiction sites, but by no way understood what “sex” actually was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Zi and Ming went to the same elementary school and were heading to the same middle school. They lived around the same area, and both had chubby cheeks and silly demeanour. But there was something that made them different: Zi was about to go to one of the top classes, while Ming one of the bottom classes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here was something that set Chinese education apart. Kids were ranked at a very young age, and those who scored lower on a test were publicly shamed. Zi remembered the teacher harshly throwing the test paper on Ming’s face and loudly demeaning her for scoring poorly. Before a student could head to middle school, the excellent students, those who were class presidents and had better grades, were sent for a lottery to be assigned to different schools. That was the first tier of students. Zi did well in class, but she didn’t really participate in any of the “class activities” she deemed pretentious and preformative. She wasn’t recommended to the school district to be in the lottery. Instead, she went in and did a test with the school. 10,000 yuan later, she was promised to be in the top class (1-4). This process was for the second tier students, those who were smart but less “well-behaved”. Then there was the last tier of students. These students were the “degenerates”, the ones deemed “failures” in the parents’ eyes. After the first and second tier of students had their pick of the schools, they were entered into a lottery, randomly assigned to the “bottom classes” (5-8) of middle schools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zi didn’t care about that. She was just exuberant that she got to go to the same school as Ming. You might say, “of course she wouldn’t care! She’s a kid”. Well, you’d be surprised how many kids in Beijing developed this early sense of “class” and how the “good” students avoided the “bad” like the plague. The top-tier students with their fancy workbook and little mechanical pencil rolled their eyes at the students who did poorly in math or English. Zi was not about that. She was raised better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The summer eventually came to an end. Zi had to be back to her parents’. Her parents were fine, but she much preferred her gentle, caring grandma and the chef grandpa who could whip up an impressive meal. Her dad frequently chastised her for “being on the phone too much” while her mom criticized all her emotional outbursts. She locked herself in the room, messaging Ming all day. This was when texts were charged individually. Soon her grandma, who was the rightful owner of the phone number, called to tell her she had overspent hundreds. And that was the end of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First day, Zi headed to the school. She discovered that she was sent to class 1. She did a little dance in her head. Class 1 was the prestigious position to be, and she didn’t expect to be placed with the first-tiers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She saw Han right away. Han was in her elementary class and one of those first-tier students. For context, Zi’s middle school was one of the worst in the district, infamous for public brawls and “gang” activities. Zi remembered how Han and several other “good” students broke into tears and huddled to cry because they were placed in the middle school that Zi was honoured to be at. Talking about dramatics. Zi rolled her eyes in her head and waved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Han signalled for her to sit, so she did. Han opted for a more stressful summer, involving coming to the middle school with some future classmates to do some extracurricular classes. Han gestured to the girl sitting next to her, “Hey, Zi, this is a friend I made during summer. Her name is Yue.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zi was not ready for socializing, and she was not ready to see a girl with a boyish haircut and tomboy demeanour. “Oh shit, I thought they were a boy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yue made an awkward smirk that would become her signature way of expressing annoyance and disgust. Neither one of them knew that this encounter would be the beginning of endless shenanigans for the years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yue made an introduction that Zi zoned out during the half of. Typical first-tiers. Excellent grades, class president, blah blah. Zi counted the minutes till she could rush to class 6 to meet Ming. Ming delivered the news in the morning, and Zi was excited to meet some cool people from the bottom class. Oh, she really thought she was the rebel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She dragged her heavy bag to the door of class 6, a behaviour the school was against. Bags must be on shoulders. Out was Ming. Zi gave her a big hug, and they squeaked excitedly as the teenagers they were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following Zi was a boy. He was a bit chubby with milk soft skin. The way he walked and waved was feminine and demure. Ming introduced, “This is Xu.” Zi said hi without thinking much, then another boy popped out of the classroom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was tall, slim, and tanned.&lt;/p>

I struggled the same way as Naomi Klein prior to putting down ideas for this book. Climate change is a broad issue that centred a lot on blaming personal choices and less concerned with corporate greed. There was always no end in sight, with fervent opponents still influencing much of the world politics. This book shed some light into the root cause of resistance, the current state (2014) of the battle against climate change, and the hopeful future outlook on this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein started the book by documenting some extreme views on the right during the Heartland institute’s international conference on climate change. The vehement denial of climate change is a display of the conservatives’ fear of shifting away from capitalist principles and the extravagant abuse of the Mother Earth. Climate change will indeed change everything. It will change the way we consume, we make money, and companies rely on oil/gas excavation/extraction will no longer be able to justify their damaging behaviour. Unfortunately, gradual change to our way of life can no longer save the planet from its eventual deterioration. Or rather, can save us from the inevitable destruction of global warming. The conservatives backed by big oil companies gathered at the Heartland convention to stop the inevitable shift in consumption and try to manipulate the public to allow the big oil companies to continue making money from putting our future in jeopardy. The truth is, a lot of people who were making an extravagant living off fossil fuels were deeply threatened by climate change. Their ideology that Earth was a source of unlimited provider of wealth was destroyed. The initial failure of most of the initiatives was caused by the difficulty addressing structural inequality and the resistance against socialism. They feared that upholding capitalism might not be feasible in the face of global warming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing the potential impact of climate change, The big oil companies and other energy players donate 900 million dollars every year to the Heartland institute and other climate denier think tank to prevent the final realization that their greed had taken our future away from us. Despite the looming danger of a warming world, politicians and corrupted scientists still claimed that global warming was a hoax. Some green activists chose to not confront the fervent fury of the climate deniers, trying to suggest the use of a technological solution. Unfortunately, high-tech solutions reinforced the idea of disaster capitalism and brought in extra emission while doing little to make a difference.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from all the deniers muddling up the water, the effort to make a difference has been thwarted by international trade law. Klein talked about the local green initiatives in Ontario, and how trade law had become an unbreakable barrier to meaningful climate change solutions. The dirtier global industrialization which required more transportation and energy waste was preferred to the cleaner local development. UN climate action failed to push for the mention of climate change in trade law led to the many failures of green energy implementation. At the same time, wealthy nations like the US could outsource the dirtiest part of industrialization to developing nations like China and India. Faced with financial needs and rapid development, developing worlds had to accept the self-destruction while becoming the scapegoat for the first world countries. As a result, there was seldom reduction in pollution internationally, while many skilled workers in wealthy nations struggled to find work, leading to nationalism and volatile societies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein proposed a series of methods to combat climate change: cheap public transit, clean light rail, and more housing along transit lines. Cities must be developed for high-density living. The development could benefit people living in poverty by providing more job and education opportunities. Besides supporting low-income communities, a luxury tax could be introduced to discourage non-necessity consumption. Implementing universal basic income could discourage wasteful consumption caused by low life quality such as impulsive shopping and encourage low carbon footprint activities such as gardening and cooking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond these methods, Klein pointed out the importance of publicizing power infrastructure. A small town in Germany in Hamburg was the example Klein used to amplify the benefits of public power ownership. Hamburg implemented clean power through public ownership and reversing private power grid. As Klein pointed out, private companies put their profits first, and would not make a significant shift to clean power willingly until every last dirty penny had been in their pockets. By making energy a part of the community’s concern, people would feel compelled to make a more sustainable decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein then indicated that it is undeniable that the increasing frequency of disasters all around the world had increase inequalities among communities. Public funding must prepare for worse climate conditions to come. To support this spending, fossil fuel companies would be heavily taxes for exchanging our future for profits. Many researches had demonstrated that by taxing the oil companies, we would have more than enough to foster a sustainable infrastructure. To rely on private companies to provide and provision power was foolish. A brand-new way to institute decentralized power locally and publicly must be adopted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein hinted that the public held the power to stop damaging and irreversible climate decisions, as the Keystone XL project demonstrated. Without regulations limiting what energy companies could and could not do, our climate future seemed dire. As more resistance came to traditional fossil fuel consumption, dirty innovations such as shale gas and fracking had came to existence. Unfortunately, these unconventional energy sources had proven to be more expensive and dirtier to extract, and they produced equally hefty carbon footprints.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make a difference that has lasting effect, we must look to the connections we have with Earth. Klein used the failure of Nauru to outline the danger of excusing treating the Earth with violence in the name of ecological growth. The invention of the steam engine had gave us the false sense of security that energy could be manipulated, while the truth was far from it. The attempted control of nature was arrogate and foolish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journey to a better relationship with earth seemed to be faced with challenges from compromises and alternative solutions. Even many of the environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy defined climate activism narrowly and accepted donation from major polluters in the name of allyship. It even went as far as performing its own gas extraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some others who want to combat climate change came up with ecological solutions like the carbon tax, yet unethical clever player in the climate game took advantage of any potential flaw. Setting fire to natural gas because it was cheaper, using high emission technology to destroy by-product, and marking nature reserves as a business to sell carbon credits and provide offsets for energy companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green billionaires like Richard Branson vowed to donate billions to groundbreaking solutions, yet the promises had not been met. The technical solutions were nothing more than disappointment. As business owner themselves, they continued to pollute the Earth while being hailed as heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radical measures such as dimming the sun were even proposed. Klein warned that the atmosphere continued to be a mysterious presence. Such permanent alteration of the climate could lead to unexpected and catastrophic consequences. Geoengineering had done little but delaying real changes that could save us from foreseeable disasters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the grim prospect on climate groups and innovation gurus, Klein didn’t forget to remind us of the positive outlook for the climate problems. Blockadia described activist groups who hid in plain sight, united by resistance to mining and energy companies. They had achieved success all around the world like no other activism. They showed up in Greece, Canada, US, UK, and any other places where energy companies dared to set foot. Communities linked arms and fought against threats to their nature resources. They had delivered the most success seen in decades.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another tactics brewing success was the divestment movement. By calling on universities, governments, and organizations to discontinue their financial holding in all fossil companies, the movement put pressures on fossil companies and marked them as undesirable and illegitimate like the tobacco companies. In the court of public opinion, fossil fuel companies had lost their standings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the most fervent participants of Blockadia were indigenous communities, who traditionally held sustainability near and dear to their hearts. Their opposition to energy companies, however, had furthered their economical disadvantage. Many of them struggled to find employment after being passed on by energy companies. Instead of giving in, Blockadia movement had found alternatives. While faced with Economical challenges, indigenous communities educated members on building houses with insulation and provided youth with better opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While celebrating our success so far, Klein didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to propose a global feed-in tariff. First world countries with high emission should compensate low-pollution developing countries that were faced with harsher environmental challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To close up the book, Klein intimately shared details of her infertility struggle. She drew the connections between pollutions and infertility, the Mother Earth and her own body, her child and baby animals. More than 3 quarters of the chemical was never tested for children. Dramatic decrease in birth and survival rate in different animals mark troubles from excavation failure, global warming, and ocean acidification. At the end, she called for an introspection on our relationship with the Mother Earth, and called for the reproductive rights for the planet as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, I have learned a lot about climate change from this book. Though I had been avoiding this topic for a long time, I am now feeling more connected to the issues facing Mother Earth than ever. One action that really resonated with me was when Klein mentioned that the transition to EV and other renewable energy sources would only be a temporary solution. The most effective strategy lies behind developing a new understanding of consumption, building cities fit for high-density living, and taxing the oil companies. There is a culture in today’s capitalist society to consume in more ways than you can imagine. Almost every new technical advancement focuses on how to take users’ data and encourage more consumption. The entire capitalist ecosystem banks on people to spend more to sustain its unsustainable design. At the same time, our Mother Earth is dying for the same consumption ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein was right. Climate change will change everything if we want to survive. Our fundamental belief in the capitalist infrastructure must be mended or abandoned to save ourselves before it is too late. As progressives, we must fight harder than the republicans and those who profit from extravagant spending to defeat the climate deniers and the powerful fossil fuel companies. The first step to this journey is to educate ourselves on the influence fossil fuel consumption has on our daily life and how much the capitalist spending habits have damaged our environment. If you have been hesitant to get involved with climate issues, this book is a great starter kit for you to become more aware and comfortable when it comes to climate change. The only way to ensure we are not robbing our grandkids of a future filled with beautiful animals and stunning landscape is to act now. Only collectively we can pressure the leaders of the world for more effective legislation and fair taxation of the rich.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rainbow Bridge</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/rainbow-bridge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 20:16:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/rainbow-bridge/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/rainbow-bridge/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Rainbow Bridge" />&lt;p>I started this piece back when you were still roaming the city&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do you see me cry in your absence&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your silky black fur shining under the boiling hot sun of summer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your welcoming tail wag when I stepped out in my sporting shorts&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your disappointed yawn when the drawer opened and revealed your secrets&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How could the universe take you away like a gust of wind&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You barely spent anytime with me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We promise we’d grow old together&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You would walk at my wedding as my ring bearer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or kiss my firstborn good night&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hiss at my toddler’s messing hands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zoom through the city with your friendly feline friends&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She’s gorgeous and sweet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but we can barely forget about you&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your grey friend no longer comes around&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guess he heard the bell ringing for your eulogy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stare out of the window twenty times a day&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waiting for the crispy sound of you coming home&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or hoping you’d hop on the window-side cabinet&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And drink from that pink water fountain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please forgive me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love you more than I love my selfish existence&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn’t fight for you hard enough this time around&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next life I’ll fend for you and die for you&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Your mischievous smile lit up the dim corner of the run-down dive bar. You look familiar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hand that laid down the first brick of the Great Wall. The noise came from the Colosseum while the gladiators fought to their deaths. The dust registered by the hooves of the ferocious Genghis Khan Army. The gasp while Marco Polo’s tale of the Far East was spreading in the rustic farm town. The rancid smoke from the burning barn carrying patients of the Black Death. The resounding gunfire while the Spanish set foot in a fruitful yet foreign land. The applause after Shakespeare enchanted the audience with his first play. The trenches filled with victories and losses of the brutal war.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You came close to me and whispered in my ear, “Have I seen you before?” Yes, you have. Too many times. I reached my hand out and you grabbed it. “No.” I said. Music drowned out your laughter and the neon light diluted your gorgeous eyes. Hello again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I met you at her funeral. I came down, missing her laughter and her eyes curved like the crescent moon. You were standing in your wrinkled black suit. Flicking the cigarette were your fingers reddened by the cold. You were her lover. At the eulogy, your deep voice was shaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That night, I called you crying, missing her nightly calls to me before depression took away her spark. The other end of the phone call was filled with sadness only describable by your silence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We bonded through our love for her. Her kindness, the little poem she wrote both of us, her finger nails bitten to so short, and how gorgeously her dress flew in the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your paint brush dirtied your denim overall. The paint stroke chaotically came together to depict nothing but the breathtaking her. We let the sunset reflect on the painting. She was alive again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt her energy when I was with you. Every breath you took she came out once again, standing at the end of the hallway, head resting on the window, eyelashes shining from her tears filled with melancholy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I told you I loved you, you didn’t even question it. Your breath was deep and warm. The room was boiling. Condensation covered the only window in the studio. In the painting, she stared back, emotionless. Your sad eyes stared down, still breathless. This was a mistake. You said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why did we make the same mistake so many times after? Did we fall in love with each other, or did we fall in love with grievance? Her shadow was ineradicable and followed us around. We could not talk about anything but how much we missed her. Is it wrong that we are doing this? I asked. You said nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was our healing process, I supposed. You stopped replying to my texts. Calls left unanswered. You put her behind, and I was the last bit of her remaining in your life waiting to be erased. I missed our late night sorrow and grieving, how your long and well-manicured fingers felt on my skin, the paint that was scattered onto my expensive clothing, and most importantly, how sad and in pain we both were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldn’t blame you. I stopped thinking about her as much. She made me too sad, too vulnerable, and too unstable. I stopped bursting into tears out of nowhere. The same brand of perfume no longer made my eyes red. Funny how fast we forgot someone we loved so deeply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I prayed to see you again, but my last message to you was left on read for months and months. Your studio light was on, but I no longer had the courage to step into that room full of memories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess that’s how most stories end. The concert jungle of our city dominated the limit of our sadness. We could only stay stagnant so long, right?&lt;/p>

Caterers dressed in black and white swiftly passed by crowds of guests who were engaged in mindless mingling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dana anxiously wiped away the champagne residue on the corner of her mouth with the pristine white cloth. Her newly touched-up lips left a smudge of redness. She sighed. The weather in St. Louis was particularly unbearable in the summer. She was anxious that she had to skip an important conference 1000 km away. Her phone had been blowing up all morning. Her companion was anxious in a different manner. His quiescent nature rendered every social situation somewhat uncomfortable at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She texted her friend Yasmin, while replying to the last 5 emails. She anxiously tapped her high heels. Yasmin was one of the few friends she kept in touch since middle school. Proudly open and queer, yet conserved and wildly religious, Yasmin painted a picture of contradiction. Chicago was merely 400 km away, across two state lines, while Dana had to take an early morning flight to cross the northern border. Dana frowned. Why was she late?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next through the door was Olivia. Dana quickly waved, while praying the grouping was intentional and not randomized. The fashion in wedding was now the encouragement of mingling and networking. Dana knew she’d be on the first flight the next morning and would rather the bride blessed her with an easy night of conversations. Olivia had been steadily climbing in her career in architecture. Sometimes Dana would see Olivia’s building while on business trips to Atlanta. Despite small and intimate, Olivia’s design had always been outstanding. Olivia did not bring a plus one. She showed up in an artistic and alternative dress with eccentric pattern. In lieu of high heels, Olivia chose a pair of yellow flats. Dana rolled her eyes in her mind but welcomed Olivia with a warm smile, “Thank god you are here! I’m bored. I don’t know anybody.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They exchanged small chatter about their career. Dana updated Olivia on her current marital and career status. She introduced herself with a smirk. A married 35-year-old with a gleaming career, she thought of herself as every career woman’s dream. Olivia refused the champagne offered by the waitress and started to list her upcoming projects. A rising star in the architect world, Olivia chose a more demure but not less exciting life: Frequent visits to art galas and social events with celebrity, yet she continued to be dedicated to art and not finance. Dana hammered Olivia’s on her relationship status, in which she replied, “I’m too busy to settle down.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Dana and Olivia were engaging in rounds and rounds of more competition than conversation, Scarlett walked in with Leah. Dana raised her brows. These two had been flown in from China. They were both followed by their husband. Dana knew them from the pictures. Scarlett married a young music professor looked particularly handsome in the tuxedo he normally posed in. Leah met an older but good-looking heir to some state fortune through her parents and got married in less than a year. Dana jumped up and gave both of them a quick hug and allowed the men to initiate their side conversation. “It’s been so long!” Dana had not seen either of these women in at least four years, “How are you?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scarlett went and started describing her music education career. As a young university post-doc, she had been fighting the university politics to finally get the professor position. If all things went well, she would be a full-time professor the next fall. Dana passed the hot tea Leah ordered instead of champagne, while she started to describe the headache of a new mother. After her chronic illness had taken away most of her energy, Leah had dedicated her life into raising her child. &amp;ldquo;A lucky son. &amp;quot; Her eyes glistened. Dana quickly swallowed the last drop of champagne in her glass and added to the conversation, “my daughter started speaking when she was only 10 months, but boys start slow.”&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Yasmin was here. Dana sighed with relief. Yasmin walked in with her usual child-like demeanour. In a dark blue suit, she had an older lady in her arm. Yasmin married her wife after years of turmoil. Her wife starting seeing her before ending her previous marriage. After playing the role of the other woman for many years, Yasmin finally came out on top and became the official spouse. Outside of her tumultuous love life, Yasmin was the producer of a TV station. Last year, Yasmin gave Dana a tour of the studio. As an ex-filmmaker, Dana felt the immense guilt that she left art behind, while picking up a quick call outside the recording studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yasmin hugged everyone and sat down the name tag with the leaf symbol. Dana laughed, “Don’t you hate these stupid labels?” Yasmin laughed loudly, while Leah shrugged, “They are kinda cute.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came the maid of honour, Yara. She covered herself in a muted yet gorgeous pink gown decorated with carefully designed flowers. Dana forced an awkward smile. When Yara got married, Dana was left out of the invitation along with Yasmin because of their collective animosity towards the groom. Dana disliked Yara’s husband, who was their middle school classmate that had once expressed interests in several other girls simultaneously. Unlike Yara who was born with a silver spoon under her short dark hair, her husband grew up dirt poor. He could hardly afford the ring on Yara’s fingers. Dana cursed him under her breath, but refused to display any discomfort. Yara had no stable job, but somehow was always travelling the world with her mom’s bank accounts. Dana and Leah looked at each other with a knowing glance. They both disliked Yara to a certain extent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yara smiled, “so glad you guys came! Especially Scarlett and Leah, all the way from China. How was the flight?” Leah was just about to speak while Scarlett took over the mic quickly, “Torture, but Hazel is getting married. We ought to be here!” Do we? Dana murmured to herself. They haven’t spoken for at least four years. Hazel was the prettiest girl in the group back in the day. Her smile had all the guys in the school mesmerized. As an ugly duckling herself, Dana had always been jealous of Hazel’s popularity. Despite growing attractive herself, Dana was still unsettled by how the amount of bullying in middle school had exacerbated her competitive nature. It must’ve easy being pretty and perfect all her life. Dana chugged another glass of champagne. Hazel had been working for an ad agency doing copywriting with her talent for language. Her soon-to-be husband’s father owned a business that made millions. A luxurious wedding. Dana thought of her own intimate yet casual wedding and moaned at the waste of money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dana looked around the table. Yasmin had her arm around her wife. Still in their honeymoon stage. Dana frowned, while watching her own husband across from her indulging in an impassioned yet random conversation with one of the other husbands. Olivia and Scarlett exchanged knowledge on education and art. They had always been the artsy type. Leah was quietly sipping on her hot tea while Yara bragging about the child-free life she led with her jobless husband. Dana touched Leah’s hand, “How is your health?” Leah looked up, “Better!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ceremony soon started. Hazel came out in a laced mermaid dress. Every inch of the dress was covered in shimmering crystals, and the delicate laces interlaced with the shines ever so perfectly. “You know my wedding dress was a simple white dress that barely cost 100 right?” Dana whispered to Yasmin. “I didn’t even have a wedding.” Yasmin laughed. Dana remembered the little wedding dinner at a small restaurant, where Yasmin shed a tear while talking about the absence of her parents. Dana sighed, watching Hazel finishing her vows while wearing that huge rock on her fingers. Hazel looks especially stunning with her bejewelled thick dark hair. The tear marks on her cheek made her look vulnerable and lovable. The emotion of the ceremony moved the entire room of guests. Even Dana felt the soreness surrounded her eyes. Yara got up and gave a quick speech. Yara and Hazel met the same time as the rest of them. As girls with broken families, they formed a much stronger bond. Yara made sure to mention the table they used to dine at in the cafeteria and expressed awe of the presence of every single member. “Can you believe it?” Olivia broke the silence, “it’s been more than 20 years. And we got to meet again. ”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It had been more than two decades since the seven of them became friends. The world had not stopped spinning for a single second. Dana had gone through several career changes and climbed the corporate ladder to where she was today. Yasmin fought tooth and nails to marry the love of her life, despite having almost everyone in the world against their marriage. Olivia pursued her dream and never in one second doubted her ability in architecture. Scarlett played the politics and finally got closer to what she deserved. Leah went through a tough time with her illness and now had a beautiful family of her own. Yara chose love over the prejudice of others. And Hazel, despite going through many difficult years as a child of an alcoholic mother, believed that she could be happy and deserve someone who loved her. Today, they had gathered together once again. Despite the long history of conflicts, animosity, and cliquey infighting, they sat together, each accomplished in their different way. Even though they had not been friends for at least one decade, they still led their separate yet full life outside that lunch table they used to sit together at. Who knows when they would be together again? Life had been consuming every single one of them’s energy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Back in the days, similar to the plot of Mean Girls, they were the popular-ish girls in the school. Hazel, Yara, and Leah were the three prettiest girls in their grade, smart and beautiful. Dana, Yasmin, Scarlett, and Olivia were the ugly ducklings who were unique in their own ways. Hazel and Yara would talk about the boys who sent the love letters. Despite equally pretty, Leah had always distanced herself from the other two pretty girls. Leah, Dana, and Yasmin had their own tight-knit clique, roaming around campus by engaging in brainless banters. Scarlett and Olivia were the outsiders of the lunch clique, but their presence always added new gossip to the mundaneness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Their unexpected friendship had all kinds of twist-and-turns. Dana remembered Yara tore up her diary with Hazel’s name after Hazel getting a love letter from a boy Yara liked. Yasmin and Dana also fought viciously over celebrities or that one female classmate Yasmin fell head over heels for. Leah frequently made snarky comments on Yara’s flamboyance. Dana rolled her eyes at Hazel’s ploy to get more boy’s attention that she was already getting. The table broke up multiple times throughout that three years. Eventually, the seven people lunch table became a rarity. Yara moved to a fancy school far away. Dana, Yasmin, and Leah started their own lunch table. Scarlett and Olivia found their new home during this hour. And Hazel floated between different tables. The last time they shared a table like they were doing at this wedding would be at least 18 or 19 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the two decades of on-and-off friendship, the seven of them got into enough trouble with each other. Yara’s rash decision to elope and Yasmin’s secret love affairs had ruffled a few feathers. An all-girl friend group could not devoid itself of gossiping and small fighting, but they grew to tolerate the little friction among each other, knowing they had established a friendship larger than themselves. The connection between them seven was beyond simple joy and support. It became the only reminder of the innocent days of middle school. They fought through all the trouble to remain connected. Despite not speaking for at least four years, Hazel remembered to gather all of them for a night of booziness and celebration. Despite the drama and the busy schedule, all six of them decided to drop everything and show up. Dana knew that she did not catch a flight, and spent a suspiciously large amount of time bickering with the TSA agent so that she could simply show her respect. In some way, she was delighted to be here. These women reminded her of her pubescent years as the awkward and chubby girl who dared to dream big. They reminded her the little secrets they used to share and the childish fights they engaged in to show how much they care for each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dana soon had too much to drink. Yasmin’s silly jokes started to fade away and become the blurry background noise. Hazel soon came over. Dana stumbled and grabbed her into a tight hug. “Congratulations.” She mumbled, “thank you for the invitation.” Hazel laughed, her laugh still as crispy as it was back in the days. “Thank you all for coming.” Dana remembered Hazel used to see her off the bus, and yelled to the crowd &amp;ldquo;Please stay alive! &amp;quot; in an attempt to embarrass the already-awkward teen Dana. “Please stay alive and live harder.” Dana cheered to the table. The women who understood the joke burst into laughter. Dana looked around the table, she hadn’t been the jokester of the group for many years after her serious focus on career and usual character as the intense woman. All of a sudden, she was transformed to that table in the cafeteria, being roasted by the other five while being self-deprecating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dana’s husband reminded her that the flight was early the next morning. Dana put down the last glass of champagne. Yasmin explained she and her wife had a hotel room booked for the weekend. “Love that for you. I have to fly back to Toronto for an important meeting.” Dana drunkenly slammed down her drink and rested her head on her husband’s shoulder. “Bye all! See you at the next wedding!” The table turned around and started at Olivia, the only single woman among all of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Olivia laughed, “or the next funeral.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dana stepped into the cab. The city draped its bright neon light on her barely open eyelids. She murmured to herself, “I should’ve never come. I’m going to be so hungover tomorrow.”&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This piece is dedicated to the six of us who are destined to suffer longer and the one girl who left too early. While we are growing older and apart, she remains beautiful and youthful in our slowly fainting memory. I wish I had a chance to say goodbye. On that subway we used to take, I jokingly told her that she would marry a gorgeous, successful man in a white suit. Her slightly curved lips told me that all that she ever wanted. Throughout her life, she dreamed to be loved and adored, yet the world has failed her by showing her unbearable cruelty. Well, she got to get married to a man she loved in this story. Not only that, her wedding was luxurious and stunning, accompanied by all of us, wishing nothing but happiness for her, just like she dreamed. And yes, I will try to stay alive for as long as I can, as I promised.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Here I am, starting my first unplugging ever. Social media, reality TV, and quick mobile game have been deterring me from focusing on my job and people around me. The habitual scrolling or the constant blaring of taboo-filled TV shows are indicators that I have been making a deal with the devil/attention merchants. I have never been one to have set a clear boundary between the internet and I. My friends know me to reply instantly and always be overshare my daily life on social media with no hesitation. This book The Attention Merchants has made me become more aware of how my attentions have been stolen and exchanged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book started with an introduction detailing a company named EFP that exchanged students’ attentions for funding for the school board. Essentially, the board entered the agreement to sell students’ attentions in exchange of free money, and corporations could then influence students’ awareness of the brands and establish life-long purchase habits. This real-life story reminds me of one episode of Daria, where the principal brought advertisements into the school for additional funding. The principal avoided scrutiny by hosting a community meeting during the Super Bowls. Even after Daria successfully exposed the principal for the reckless money grabber she was, we saw Daria and Jane walked out of the school building covered in Ultra Cola ads. Jane looked at Daria and declared success sarcastically since the ads could only be displayed outside of school. That storyline is incredibly similar to that of this book and every attention revolution. When a new form of attention merchants emerge, people usually are oblivious. Then they become outraged once these merchants’ evil practices have been exposed. Eventually, the attention merchants provide enough convenience for the users that people just sit there and accept them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Wu painted this egregious picture of improper marketing practice, he introduced us to the first attention merchant. Benjamin Day, a print shop proprietor, decided to include advertising in newspapers to reduce cost. His newspaper, the &lt;em>New York Sun&lt;/em>, became the leading paper in a year solely relying on taboos and its low cost. His practice started a new category of news coverage that used attention grabbing as its main concern. In 1835, the Sun convinced most people that there were little creatures on the moon.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu then introduced the first cultural revolt against the attention merchants. The invention of Jule Chéret , the advertising posters, took over the streets of Paris and started to become an assault on everyone’s eyeballs. This intrusion of attention harvesting eventually led to the anti-poster movement and limited the poster spread. There was something deeper behind simply aesthetic concerns. The awareness of one’s attention being exchanged for financial gains without one’s consent is the ultimate insult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The industry that became the likely representation of attention merchants turned out to be patent medicine, any sorts of natural healing products that provided nothing of scientific evidence. Claude Hopkins led the campaign to oversell these products and bring the manufacturer a large sum of money, while the actual ingredients of these products had no real medical benefits and were actually toxic. When you find pamphlets from random stores in your mailbox, you have Hopkins to thank! He invented “direct mailing”. When the patent medicine empire of Hopkins was just starting to grow, Samuel Adams, a former crime reporter, exposed the truth behind these products. To the consumer’s shock, some products contained sulphuric acid and the lab testing on animals had led to fatality. FDA was established as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu then described the marketing strategies used by royalty. During the First World War, Lord Kitchener recruited soldiers and inspired the iconic “Uncle Sam”. His fingers pointed to whoever was reading the poster with the caption “Your country needs YOU”. The British invented the war propaganda and would subsequently become the inspiration of the Soviet Union, communist China, and Nazi Germany. America was the next to follow in the political propaganda. George Creel, an assistant to Woodrow Wilson’s campaign, convinced the Americans that going to war was the patriotic choice and spread nationalist propaganda. The ordinary people were giving pro-war speeches, and propaganda films were produced. Uncle Sam came out during this time as well. People who were anti-war were arrested under the Espionage Act. The propaganda of the British and American filled some journalists with dismay, but some paid attention to the effectiveness of total government campaigns. Among those was Hitler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu introduced Scientific Advertising, a term included demand engineering, branding, and targeted advertisements. This scientific approach took over the advertising world. The predominant figure in this era was surprisingly once again Hopkins, who came out of his retirement. Products now utilized fear campaign, Freud’s unconsciousness, and results of different experiments. Brands now were associated with more than products, but an identity. Soon after, the men in advertising realized that women were often the missing targets of the market. Helen Landsowne, a female advertiser, used the common desire of women to be beautiful and implied that a product had the potential to lead to a better life. In the meantime, some products used fear to create market demands, some products associated themselves with political movements and traits consumers identified with, and some products used Celebrity endorsement as a new force in advertising. During this era, advertiser became smarter and sneakier, using a wide range of tools to capture attention of those who were missed with the initial strategy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wu then illustrated the stories of the &lt;em>Lucky Strike&lt;/em>. The success of its branding started with the false claim of the health benefits of &lt;em>Lucky strike&lt;/em> cigarettes and the “toasting” process. The classic doctor endorsement appeared in their advertisement. To get women to smoke, they framed smoking as an act of feminist freedom and acclaimed smoking as a weight-loss treatment. Quite despicable, but it worked wonders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon came the consumer movement, incited by the manifesto &lt;em>Your Money’s Worth&lt;/em>. Many former copywriters described the evil practices of advertising after the exposé. Along with the financial burdens caused by the Depression, Americans became angry towards the attention merchants. Advertisement should distribute information for the consumers, but based on these articles, these attention merchants had disobeyed the rule of the free market. An economist, Edward Chamberlin, criticized brand loyalty. As a result, FTC regained its power and oversaw advertising practices. The attention merchants, though weakened, had not had their last laughs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu started the next chapter, introducing the radio. Radio advertising had emerged as a new form of attention capturing technique. The hit radio show &lt;em>Amos n Andy&lt;/em> became the first prime-time show, with Pepsodent, a failing toothpaste company, as the sponsor. As the show became the most popular show, even to this day, NBC learned that they can “sell eyeballs”, Pepsodent’s sale increased more than two folds, and an industry found out that they could own a part of the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To compete with NBC, The CBS president, Paley decided CBS would provide content for free in exchange for sponsored content. Paley discovered Orson Welles and other talents, but he also remembered to set a limit on its advertising to keep CBS interesting and critics-free. CBS was also the first network to hire its own reporters. To prove to sponsors that their generosity had indeed made a difference in their sales, the &lt;em>Audimeter&lt;/em>, the early form of the Nielson box, was invented.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the time has come to talk about one of the most predominant and notorious attention merchants. Adolf Hitler reintroduced the standing German army after the last notes of Beethoven’s Symphony. Hitler learned from the best: the British propaganda in the First World War. He understood the only way to break the German’s objectivity was to tend to the less educated masses. As a former ads man, he suggested that propaganda had an important goal to attract attention. To suit the message to the “the great mass”, the message must be simple and resolved to slogans and small words. He knew emotions were more welcomed than persuasion, and crowd psychology moved even those who were intelligent. Other than the fact that he was already naturally blessed with an enunciation and charisma beyond any men, the radio played a crucial role in Hitler’s domination. The propaganda took over all air time as the more German started to listen to the radio. Opposed to the advertisers, instead of informing people of their choices, Hitler took away people’s freedom to observe other opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the war ended, televisions took over America by storm. &lt;em>I love Lucy&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Ed Sullivan Show&lt;/em> took CBS over the edge. TV advertisement was the next to follow, with Kellogg, Cadillac, Marlboro leading the trend. Warm association added an extra layer of attraction for company branding. Soon, 6he Competition between NBC and CBS brought quiz shows to drew audiences. Attention merchants like pain relievers and Crest did not miss the advertising break during these attention-grabbing shows to demonstrate their brand superiority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time of TV show prosperity came a second attention revolt. This time around, it was the invention of remote controls. Remote controls gave the audience the freedom to move their attention away from the ads and to freely choose something more entertaining. Ads were revealed to be extremely effective when it came to attention manipulation, and game shows were exposed to be staged for dramatic effects. These scandals eventually led to the 60s attention revolt. Timothy Leary, a former Harvard professor, led the Great Refusal by following the most revolutionary American slogans and invented “Turn on, Tune in, Drop out”. To his surprise, as he appropriated the advertisers’ tactics, the advertisers similarly used his cause for their purpose. Pepsi, hoping to end their underdog journey, identified themselves with the attention revolt. They became the representation of youth, individualism, and anti-establishment. Against Coke’s all-American brand association, Pepsi started to close the gap slowly. During the same era, the attention merchants turned themselves to the children. Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, and Charlie Brown captured Children’s attention. New advertisers associated brands with social issues that were the centre of conversations such as the second-wave feminism. Unfortunately for the resistance, capitalism had and continued to be known to be resilient and adaptable. Capitalism in the 70s wrote individualism and freedom into its playbook, continuing to deny a simple way of living to Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To distribute advertisements more efficiently, a former New York University professor, Robbin, developed computer models PRIZM (Potential Ratings in ZIP Markets) and sorted the US into clusters with different shopping habits and living conditions. Based on the cluster a household is in, advertisers sent out pamphlets and produced billboards based on their profiles. Cable networks targeting each cluster started to pop out, ESPN, BET, and Bravo. Fox News also started as a target network for conservative viewers. With the increasing numbers of TV channels, channel surfing had emerged as an unintended consequence, producing inattentive scattered viewers. Commercials learned about celebrity endorsement. Super Bowl became a spectacle. The great refusal ended with a whimper, leading to a more capable and effective attention economy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Wu covered the appearance of the third screen - the computer screen. The email was invented and saved the internet from a premature death. The check-in ritual, habitual checking of your digital mailbox to see if there was any new email, would eventually become the mode of attention capturing for all social media. The first spam mail was a several-page long invitation to an event. Though even the Pentagon was furious with the spam mail, trolling and spamming never truly stopped after that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The potential of computer for personal entertainment was soon discovered. The arcade game &lt;em>Space Invaders&lt;/em> took over the world by storm. A new model, cash for experience, was invented. The urge to complete against others made the game an addiction. To win over women and girls, &lt;em>Pac-Man&lt;/em> then became a social craze. To encourage more casual use of the internet, four companies competed for dominance in the computer network. These subscription based services offered access to then-government-owned internet with a small selection of online spaces. AOL used communities to entertain themselves. Despite the lack of funding compared to all other companies, AOL came up with a strategy, to make its space happy and friendly. It’s infamous chat rooms allowed private rooms, which eventually evolved into sex-related flirtation. Prodigy, one of the other companies, implemented a profanity ban in its chat rooms as they tried to keep the chat rooms pristine. The Draconian method to online speech eventually attracted more users to AOL. With 4 million users, AOL came out in front. To continue its growth, AOL offered advertisement rights to companies. These companies engaged in bidding wars to be able to advertise their products in AOL. The dawn of the internet started as an intense war zone, but the competition certainly did not stop here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Internet was still in its cradle stage, the entertainment industry was evolving in the speed of lightening. Celebrity power was harnessed to strengthen attention merchants’ hold on the mass. &lt;em>Times&lt;/em> and &lt;em>People&lt;/em> filled their pages with celebrity gossips and personality stories. For any platform invented after, celebrities became the attention merchants’ first bait, luring people in. For example, the celebrity-focused television,
Oprah’s show became a huge success through combining entertainment with her supportive discussion, the fascinating cuisine, and her spiritual/religious objectives. Even with more competition, Oprah stayed on top. Her personal growth theory encouraged consumption, and a single sentence of endorsement booked $90,000 in a single afternoon. The Oprah empire was soon established from the audiences&amp;rsquo; frenzy. Though eventually the rating of her show dropped due to her endorsement of the law of attraction, and her TV channel drowned into the hundreds of channels now on TV, her rise to fame did inspire many other shows like Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray, and other product endorsement focused celebrity shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reality TV was soon invented by MTV. Despite the initial backlash, reality shows proved themselves to be cheaper to produce and sometimes more attention capturing compared to TV shows. Reality TV shows appealed to the mass and promised celebrity and fame to the ordinary people. This promise produced a sustainable economy similar to the capitalism‘a promise of richness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the internet finally became a free and unlimited space for everyone to enjoy, Google, with its clean algorithms and limited ads interface, started to attract users. To sustain its growth, instead of delivering ads that were purely distracting, Google designed targeted ads that added values to the customer’s experience. Using AdWords (now known as Google Ads), Google became the most profitable attention merchant. Blogging became a trend among internet users. The sharing of a blog became a new way to harvest attention. YouTube as a form of self-expression attracted amateurs, professionals, and commercial content. The Huffington Post was established as a prime utiliser of the clickbait.
Young Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook with his determination to prove that he was the better developer. Turned out that people loved sharing personal details and experience online. It surpassed MySpace because of its control of page design and proper control of certain content. It took over the social media world because of its stability and usability. Though Facebook could not conveniently insert ads like Google, it eventually found other ways to demonstrate its advertising value. Its like buttons tracked people’s preference so appropriate ads could be shown to its users. The beauty of social media proved to be attractive in a Skinneresque manner. Though most content was disappointing, the occasional rewards kept people coming back for more. At the same time, Twitter provided a platform for everyone to share their everyday thoughts casually. The invention of followers conveniently pushed interesting content to everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the competition among social media sites were heating up, phone arrived as the fourth screen thanks to the Canadian company BlackBerry. While different mobile games were trending, Instagram appeared as a picture-centric social media application. Successful attention merchants like the Kardashian utilized this new media to resell attention and amounted to millions of dollars.&lt;br>
Netflix became a successful attention merchant without an ad-centric approach. The word “binge-watching” was included in the dictionary thanks to Netflix’s rise to popularity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the other tech companies indulged in attention resale and privacy erosion. Apple decided that they would choose privacy of their customers as their priorities. Apple implemented tracker and ads blockers, infuriated attention merchants like Mark Zuckerberg. This act of privacy protection also put Android in peril, since Google had chosen the attention model of operation, making it difficult for Android to come out on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu concluded that we may never fully get rid of attention merchants. Ultimately, advertisements served as informative tools for the consumers. Yet, there had been too little regulations imposed on how intrusive these attention merchants could be. With the convenience and entertain under our fingertips, we, in exchange, had our privacy eroded by attention merchants. These attention merchants are intruders in our daily lives. Without our consent, these merchants took away our privacy and occupied our freedom in exchange for free or cheap entertainment. Wu encouraged us to reclaim our time and emphasized the damage it may have on society if most of our attention was spent unfocused and scattered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His call to action did give me the idea for starting the unplugging. The book comprehensively described the evolution of attention merchants and highlighted different strategies to capture attention. We have long been warned that social media like Instagram and Facebook have negative effects on our mental health. Companies use ads to create unnecessary demands and use social issues to raise brand awareness. We are constantly distracted by different attention merchants craving for our attentions. Short videos on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram reduced our attention span to quick burst of interesting moments. With the rising popularity of different streaming platform, we no longer carefully analyze the shows we watch. Instead, we binge through multiple shows a week. Crazy enough, some platforms invite us to watch shows with two times the speed. Everything in our life exist with the secondary purpose to resell our attention. Research in computer science and data science is focusing on distributing ads more efficiently. The world exists in serving the capitalist purpose to gain more profits for the attention merchants. I miss the days before the internet and phones, when we spent time outdoors and read a lot more. I miss the days before social media commercialization where we simply went online for socialization and not scrolling through pages of advertisements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to live like that again, authentic and pure, stress-free yet purposeful. Even if I do wish to exchange my attention for entertainment or convenience, it better be a thoughtful and relaxing experience with my full consent, rather than the 50-page privacy agreement the companies are pushing onto us. It is the time to call for another attention revolt, even if it’s one that only involves one person, you. I refuse to let attention merchants occupy my thoughts. My thoughts that are better spent on the real, touchable beauty in the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cats I Met in Toronto Cat Rescue</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/cat-tcr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 17:35:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/cat-tcr/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/cat-tcr/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Cats I Met in Toronto Cat Rescue" />&lt;p>This post is dedicated to those beautiful feline friends I encountered while volunteering for Toronto Cat Rescue. In a tiny room, less than 5 square meters, we shared bonds that could not be understated by the limited time we spent together. These are cats who were born into misery, whose mom was abandoned, who had gone through drastic changes in their lives, or whose existence had been doomed. Yet through these difficult circumstances, they became the most resilient, the sweetest, and the most hopeful creatures I had ever seen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A recording pops up on her phone for review. She has done this plenty of times. It’s amusing how much more you start to learn once you have joined the force. On the recording, a young woman, presumably Amy, whispers to the microphone, confirming the order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flowers in her yard are blooming gorgeously on this early summer day. The neighbour waves at her when she comes out to collect the mail. Her phone buzzes. Two addresses pop up in the text preview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beauty of the organization is that almost everything is autonomous and anonymous. No one in the organization has access to the information of a pickup, drop-off, or host family. She doesn’t know who started the organization or even who is in the organization besides the handful of host families she has personally met. No one but the algorithm knows that she will have to be at this first address in 5 days, pick up some scared young woman named Amy, and drop her off at the second address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her hands sweat profusely when the thought of the mission pops up in her head. She drops her phone by accident. Her neighbour smiles, and she shrugs. Three mindless chatters and a half later, she closes the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4-days-till-the-mission">4 days till the mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fifteen years ago, she was in a similar situation. Teenage and pregnant. She wore the baggy hoodie on top of her fragile little body in and out of the rundown apartment to hide the increasingly noticeable baby bump and the bruises. The baby’s father was ten years her senior, with the smell of lcohol on his breath and clumsy body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She had nobody after her mother passed away. The world was closing in on her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She usually barely conversed with anybody except the shopkeep while shopping for groceries. One day, the sweet and gentle old lady who always browsed magazines at the bodega stopped her. She was flustered, but the old lady had a voice serene like a jar of marmalade. “Are you in some kind of trouble, sweetheart?” She remembered what the old lady said. She rushed home, hands shivering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since that night, every time she went to the bodega, she would be stopped by the old lady for a small chat. Her baby bump started to protrude from even her baggiest hoodie. The man at home was still merciless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, she told the old lady everything. She remembered they hid under the hood of the tiny bodega while the falling rain poured, the old lady’s wrinkled hand on her recovering bruises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A month later, closer to the baby’s due date, while the man was snoring after yet another drunken rage, she took everything she owned. She took the leap of faith and got into that white sedan with the hazard light blinking in the middle of the night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She decides to drive to the first address after work to familiarize herself with the area. The address is near a park in the middle of the city. Nearby some kids are screaming in glee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She steps out of the car to explore the area. The sky is sapphire blue. She wonders how close this place is to Amy’s house. Her mind wanders back to the shabby apartment with the rusted fire exit. She wonders if Amy is as tiny and clueless as she was, staring out of the window, counting the seconds till the escape. She even wonders if any of the accompanying women in the park is indeed Amy, putting on a fake smile with strenuous effort, pulling up her top to hide any evidence of dismay.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-days-till-the-mission">3 days till the mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Her son is sick today. He locks himself up in the basement. She can hear his loud voice leak through the basement door while squandering another day playing video games. She sighs while putting the coffee cups away and drives off to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She still remembers how hard the pregnancy was. She spent a lot of time going in and out of the doctor’s office. She remembers the stern face of the doctor while explaining that the lack of nutrition throughout the first half of her pregnancy may lead to some health concerns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The host family offered to pay for supplements and bought baby clothes and toys. She cooked and cleaned even though the host family insisted on her resting most of the day. For the rest of the days, she hid in the house, refusing to expose to sunlight. She spent the next five years looking over her shoulder and waking up in the middle of the night in cold sweats. She saw herself a thousand times back in the suffocating room with the man’s snoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the baby turned one, she decided to move out of the host family. She never had a job, nor did she have anybody. The welfare cheque the host family helped her sign up for was abysmal. She had to get a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her elderly neighbour watched the baby for most days while she ran around the neighbourhood looking for minimum wage jobs. The thrifted blouse had lost its original colour and barely fit her body. She had never had a job nor made a cent on her own. So when the first paycheque arrived, she cried.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She arrives at her office. She is an accountant working for a mid-level corporation. The water cooler talks are bland and repetitive, but she feels blessed listening to Debbie complaining about her 20-year-old daughter. She calls her son around noon and remind him of the pasta she left in the fridge. He frequently goes all day without eating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He has asked her about his father before, but she tells him that she will tell him more once he turns 18. When he was younger, he would always get upset about not having a father. She did all she could to provide for him and comfort him. He is now a respectful teenager with an appropriate amount of pent-up anger and brainless behaviours. He has adjusted well to the world though the first couple of years of his existence was chaotic and brutal. Last year on Mother’s Day, he bought her a bouquet with his lousy handwriting. She still keeps the card in her drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-days-till-the-mission">2 days till the mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The city starts to pour. The drive back home is wet and blurry. She turns off the radio and sits in silence for a bit. The phone vibrates. It’s a reminder of the mission. “A delivery is scheduled for 2:30 am.” The coldness of the message feels almost industrial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The truth is hidden under the glittery cover of a jewelry delivery.
She got involved with the organization by accident. One of her close friends familiar with her experience confided in her and told her about the organization. Over the alcohol scent of the late-night cocktail, she decided to apply through the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this enormous and mysterious web of men and women, who believe in rescuing women in abusive relationships who cannot escape through their means, comes together in this organization, anonymously hoping to save one life at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Someone experiencing domestic violence can choose to purchase a 9-inch chain, one bracelet, and one earring. It stands for 911. The system will first confirm the order or that there is indeed a woman in need by calling the number provided. The confirmation will be replayed to multiple participants of the transfers to ensure authenticity. Then the system automatically schedules a series of transfers to avoid having the victim being tracked by the abuser. A woman in need may go through 3 to 5 host families before settling down in one family. Another transfer may be scheduled anytime if the woman feels like their safety is compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She didn’t have such an organized support system back in the day. The driver who picked her up was the son of the elderly lady, and the host family was his friend’s. They did the best they could with the limited recourses, but she has always been grateful. These people who were strangers risked their safety and sacrificed their security to protect a woman whom they barely knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though the host family is more than 100 miles away from where she used to live, she spent most of her first year tiptoeing around the world outside of her basement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She remembers the day when a familiar face popped up near her host family during her walk with her son. One of his friends was in fishing attire, wandering around the street. The small-town summer attracted a lot of people from the city.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She panicked, dragging the stroller down the street. The horror was indescribable. Suddenly, she was once again sitting quietly in that smoke-filled room, not daring to make a single sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She ran and ran and ran. The stroller slowed her down. She couldn’t remember how many people she ran into or how long she was running. She stopped at the back of a construction site with sweat dripping down her face. Inside the stroller, her son was crying hysterically. A construction worker walked past her, “Ma’am, are you alright?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day she started to pack up. Within a week, she stepped onto the platform of a train south.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The map on her car GPS slowly turns from red to yellow. The traffic in front of her starts to dissipate. She puts down her phone and brings her thoughts back to reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-day-till-the-mission">1 day till the mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thunders once again surround the city. After cooking dinner, she feels a bit nervous about the pickup tomorrow. It is not her first time, but she understands the risk never diminishes no matter how experienced she becomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is the day. She clenches her fist. Her son is quietly on his phone at the kitchen table. His rare presence at the dinner table is amusing. She raises her eyebrows and asks what the special occasion is. He shrugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nobody knows that she is a part of the organization, not even the friend who initially introduced her to it. It is one of the rules to keep each mission as secretive as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After dinner, she leaves to top up gas. While she is pumping gas, a man comes up to her and asks for direction. She suspiciously answers with a brief description. Doesn’t everyone have a google map on their phone these days?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, he asks, “May I have your number?” She politely rejects while stating that she has a boyfriend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, that statement is a lie. She has barely dated since the escape over a decade ago. Besides the stress of being a single mother, she has trouble navigating through the dating world. Her brief period of therapy has been cut short due to the lack of money and time. She hasn’t had a chance to fully isolate herself from the nightmares that still revisit her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While studying accounting, she did meet a gentle young man at school. She was working and studying full time, leaving her son all day with the babysitter and the neighbour. He would come over after school and before the end of her shift and look after her son.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her son enjoyed every second of his company. They would play soccer in the park next to her apartment. On the weekend, he took him to bbq while she spent all day cleaning. So when he decided to end the relationship, her son was devastated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things went downhill once the conversation on next steps started to come up. He was eager to push the relationship to the next level, while she refused to rush into anything. Suddenly, the only father figure her son had ever had exited out of his life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was called to school to pick up her misbehaving son after he got into a fight. The sun was shining down brightly on the dusty park swings. She sat next to him with the clenched fists and tears running down his bloody nose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that relationship, she’s been more careful with letting her guards down with anyone new. The next thing she knows, she is approaching her 40s, her son is almost an adult, and she is still alone and fragile in the world, scared to commit. How can she risk another incident that can lead to another devastation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She pulls up in her driveway. The LED light in her son’s bedroom is changing colour gradually. Tomorrow is the day. She is ready, yet when is she really ready?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-day-of-the-mission">The day of the mission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>She tiptoes downstairs. The moonlight spills all over the front of her front yard like milk. Cicadas sang vibrantly. She gets in her car. The sound of the engine floods her ears. She takes a deep breath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the designated spot, she parks her car and sits in complete darkness. She has to wait 30 minutes before aborting the pickup. She looks around the area. It’s 2:30 am. Every house on the street is sleeping on this peaceful night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, a tiny shadow on the corner scratches and breaks the silence of the night. A young girl appears under the street light. The girl is dragging a large duffel bag while wearing a baggy T-shirt, looking fragile and scared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She turns on her hazard lights. The girl’s eyes brighten up. The girl walks a little faster now, but the bag slows her down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She comes out and walks out of the car. “This is for the jewelry delivery?” The girl nods timidly and fixes the collar of her T-shirt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They drive off. She looks at the girl in the trunk. The girl, presumably Amy, is looking out the window nervously with her hands awkwardly placed on her tiny thighs. She hears Amy’s little voice in the back of the car, &amp;ldquo;Thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They arrive at the drop-off location. She opens the trunk and takes out Amy&amp;rsquo;s duffle bag. She turns around, and Amy is standing next to the car door with tears all over her face. &amp;ldquo;I am scared.&amp;rdquo; Amy can barely mutter a complete sentence, &amp;quot; I have never been alone before. I don’t know if I can make it&amp;hellip; I don’t know how to survive on my own&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She cuts her off sternly, &amp;ldquo;You will make it! You have to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She takes Amy’s hands in hers. She sees her younger teenage self in Amy’s sniffling. &amp;ldquo;You’re stronger than you can ever imagine. You have to believe it. Today will be the beginning of the toughest battle you’ll ever face, but you will make it. You have to tell yourself that. Now, go on and ring the doorbell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amy looks down for a minute and then nods. She watches Amy dragging the oversized duffle bag to the front door and ringing the doorbell. Someone comes out, confirms the details, and takes Amy in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She stands in the walkway that is blossoming with tulips. It’s a beautiful summer night. Another girl’s life is forever changed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection on "Capitalist Realism"</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 16:56:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Reflection on "Capitalist Realism"" />&lt;p>As a Bernie bro turned half-closeted anti-capitalist, I am slightly embarrassed to admit that this book is the first book I’ve read that goes in-depth explaining capitalism. Life in engineering has completely devoid me of any free time to sit down and read. This free time after graduation becomes the first time in a long while that I could indulge my curiosity about late-term capitalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fisher started the book with the description of a vital scene in the movie &lt;em>Children of Men&lt;/em>. He then brought up the phrase:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In two pages, Fisher immediately captured the reader. It is undeniably true that often time in any discussion regarding anti-capitalism, a common response from the opposer is usually that though capitalism is evil, there is simply no other viable political and economical system. Thus, capitalist realism: the belief that capitalism is “real” and the only plausible social system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fisher then dived into a discussion about arts in the modern days and explained how hip-hop has gained increasing popularity. Fisher explained postmodernism briefly and pointed out that the current over-saturation of media is largely a phenomenon of late-capitalism: once a certain story/style has gained considerable popularity, artists/producers are reluctant to produce anything new. They reproduce the same storylines or music (if it ain’t broke and brings in profit, why fix it?). A prime example of this is the number of box office movies that fall into the “remake” genre.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next couple of chapters, Fisher declared that moral criticism of capitalism only reinforces capitalist realism. This discussion reminds me of what Jeremiah Whitewhale said in the TV show &lt;em>Bojack Horseman&lt;/em>, after Diane confronted him on his evil anti-labour practice. He claimed that when news about his company evil practices come out, people think the company is uncompromised by morality, the stock goes up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the stranglehold capitalist realism has exacted on most people, Fisher illuminated that the only way to dismantle capitalist realism is to point out the inconsistencies within the capitalist ideals. Besides the already contested climate change issue, Fisher emphasized two other areas of discussion - mental health and bureaucracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next chapter, Fisher discussed reflexive impotence and depressive hedonia. He had an intriguing proposition that the individualization of mental health problems - “treating them as if they were caused by chemical imbalances in the individual’s neurology and/or by their family background“ - took out the possibility of societal causation. He then explained depressive hedonia: the phenomenon where depression is the result of the constant craving for pleasure. I am by no means an expert in depression or any other mental illness, but I am reluctant to agree that what gives rise to depression is a societal one and not a chemical one. I would be more inclined to accept this proposition if there is more evidence that there is more than a correlation between mental health issues and the over-saturation of media. Though it is evident that the number of people with diagnosed mental health issue skyrocketed in the last decade, based on a press release by American Psychological Association (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/03/mental-health-adults" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mental Health Issues Increased Significantly in Young Adults Over Last Decade&lt;/a>), I attribute some of these effects to the developing and more comprehensive mental health support nowadays. These doubts aside, teens’ constant obsession over the “matrix” - as Fisher named the social media - harms their mental health. (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.statista.com/topics/9178/social-media-and-teenage-mental-health/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Social media and teenage mental health - Statistics and Facts&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Post-Fordism and the instability of the current workplace culture leak through workers’ workplaces and into their everyday lives. Due to the insepration between life and work, more workers suffer from mental distress. Without the assurance of job security, people are suffering from increasing stress. Yet, Fisher reminds us that capitalism denies any societal effects that may have led to this mental health endemic. At the same time, an abundance of wealth has been made by the pharmaceutical companies in the treatment of mental illness.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next chapter, Fisher discussed the bureaucracy stemming from capitalism. Though theoritically capitalism aims to eliminate the bureaucracy in Stalinism by making all processes transactional, bureaucracy exists in capitalism more consistently and less tangibly. For example, there is no formal review in the workplace, but many employees are asked to set goals and self-reflect. The phrase “work smarter, not harder” emphasizes the need for change and puts immense pressure on the employees to adapt to the ever-changing labour market. I have always demised when companies ask for employees with multi-skills while offering salaries that one can barely scrape by. The obnoxious discussion of “lifelong learning” and “key-shaped person” implies that to be successful, one must be ready to constantly adapt to new challenges and reshape oneself. This implication is an unfair request from the capitalist society to employees while not providing any security and stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the inconsistencies of mental health and bureaucracy in capitalism, Fisher expresses his belief that capitalist realism is a merely plastic reality that is reconfiguring itself constantly. Capitalism urges people to adapt to changes with ease. The strongest survivors of the capitalist society believe that nothing is constant but change. Due to the lack of a central exchange in a capitalist society, people largely overlook the capital or big corporations as the culprits for large-scale societal problems. For example, people largely blame the government for the 2008 financial crisis while the behaviour of capital plays an essential role. Capitalism tends to resolve problems by making them everyone&amp;rsquo;s problems. Fisher used recycling as an example. The responsibilization results in no one really taking care of the problem. I have always been angry at politicians who deflected by claiming battling climate change is everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility. These very same politicians have been accepting donations from big oil companies and caressed by climate change denying lobbiests. Despicable of them to shame us for driving to work/school under the underfunded public infratstructure, while allowing the large carbon producers roam free.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fisher ended the book with the forewarning that late-term capitalism may divert to social democracy or authoritarianism. He warned that any effective anti-capitalist social system must be a rival to capitalism and not a reaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I genuinely enjoyed this book. This book is one of the first pieces of literature I have touched on in a few years, and it resonated with a lot of my frustrations. As a newbie in the anti-capitalist world, this book is a fantastic introduction to and an engaging discussion of many facets of late-term capitalism. There are a lot of &amp;ldquo;Ah-ha&amp;rdquo; moments in this book, such as the phenomena of postmodernism, the instability in the post-Fordism era, the omnipresence of bureaucracy in the workplace, and the responsibilization of all world problems. When I was studying film, our screenwriting professor would tell us to only write stories with happy endings and follow the Hollywood plotline. Such misfortune in the artistic world is a reflection of late-term capitalism phenomena. I used to take pride in being very flexible, but now I am aware that this flexibility is a reaction to the ever-changing climate in the labour market. Being able to reflect on many aspects of my own life has been refreshing. I will revisit this book after reading more anti-capitalist/marxist literature to gain a clearer understanding of Fisher&amp;rsquo;s references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an astonishingly positive experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/links/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
