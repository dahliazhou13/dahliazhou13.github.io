Sea level rising

Forests burning

The stock market screaming the prelude to doomsday

You are holding my hand

Under the darkness of the starless sky of Toronto

With cars zooming by

Leaving trails of light pollution 

The car still smells of 

Lust desire and intimacy

These are sparkles and dreams in your eyes

That I am planting

Along with those kisses

Guns blazing

Protests raging

Warships lining up the dazzling reflection of explosions

Your lips are on mine

The perfect day to 

Let the fire swallow us whole
