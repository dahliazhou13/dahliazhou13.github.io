I am officially entering the capitalist society tomorrow. In an
attempt to document my overflowing melancholy, I put my distress
into not-so-pretty words.

Three years ago I was wiping down tables 2 am in
the waitress outfit while responding to drunk men’s life stories.
Three years later I am about to enter an office facing the waterfront.
Funny how life twists you around in the wind like a plastic bag. Was
I happier, I wonder? There’s beauty in living life as a witness to the
corporate world. They come in for a quick lunch that requires you to
sweat all over the floor, or they stop by for a drunken holiday dinner
with the boss laughing “oh my wife’s name is Doris too”. I was a
brief piece of recollection in their mundane life and hopefully a
semi-memorable moment during their boring routine. Fast cars
passing by the building could catch a glimpse of my silhouette, and
it was the perfect amount of existence I wish to leave this world.

Oh well, now I’ll be one busy body in the thousands crossing the
vibrant streets of downtown Toronto. I’ll be one girl with the messy
hair impatiently in line with the other hundreds at Starbucks,
confirming the order with the barista. The universe makes no
mistake letting me drown in the crowd. There’s fascination in being
submerged in mediocrity. At age 13, I wrote in my diary, “Have
ambitions less than that of your talent”. At age 14, I wrote, “Have
the most significant ideals”. Well, which one is it? I bet either one of
them will be disappointed, or both. But at least the second half of
both sentence agreed that fitting into the ordinary world is a
fascinating act. “Have ambitions less than that of your talent. Let
your outlook blend in with the grass and trees”. Being content with
mediocrity is a skill to be acquired, or maybe I am being
brainwashed by Confucius again. I am still learning to be
comfortable with not being outstanding or significant. The charm of
being in my late twenties is that I have had plenty of time to drown
my egos in the world of disappointment. My self-importance has
been abandoned with my chokers in the junk drawer, deemed
unfashionable.

Maybe I’ll never put my Superman suit on and save the world,
and that’s okay. The world needs too much salvation that one
woman cannot provide.

Those cliché starts of action movies where the heroes were
found working at blue collar jobs or hiding out in a remote island
were accurate depictions of the universe. There once was a
moment of glamour, and now we are left with holes that can only be
filled with a life of sweat and conformity. I still want to be great, but I’m willing to give that up for a mortgage and a bunch of children to
suffer the same fate.

Life sure has a way to beat you down to nothingness. Well
played! You gave me all the passion and dedication, so I could play
support for one evil corporation after another. You gave me all the
right sense of morality, so I could lie to myself that I’m doing the
right thing. I understand despair like no other. But you know what,
I’m alive bitch. You can’t take that away from me. Not just yet.
