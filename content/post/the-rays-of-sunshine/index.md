The rays of sunshine lightly brushing your face

Became the source of my jealousy

She could touch your gorgeousness

More often than I

My trembling voice so clumsy

Again professed my love for you

Unprovoked

Your body temperature well above 90 Fahrenheit

Or whatever the Americans declare as fever

You worked your magic again

Natural talent

Left me breathless

How your warmth and passion manoeuvre

Drowned me in a brand new emotion

Invented by god himself

Oh yeah guided by blasphemy and prophecy

Our fate intertwined us to be the

Surprising duo

Your piano guitar and video game

My writing and mindless chatter

In another life I mustâ€™ve met you sooner

Could you rescue me

From deception disappointment or despair?

Your embrace became my only safe harbour

Your presence lit up all five of my

Not too sensitive senses

In front of you my soul was bared before my breasts

You were still making those silly jokes

Did you see how I carved out my heart

Served it to you on a platter going for broke?

The moment you kissed me in front of the geese

I was saved

Shining lake

Here I was begging the universe to rewrite history

"Let me meet him earlier"

I cried

It responded with a hollow and echoey voice

"You met him at just the right time"
