I struggled the same way as Naomi Klein prior to putting down ideas for this book. Climate change is a broad issue that centred a lot on blaming personal choices and less concerned with corporate greed. There was always no end in sight, with fervent opponents still influencing much of the world politics. This book shed some light into the root cause of resistance, the current state (2014) of the battle against climate change, and the hopeful future outlook on this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein started the book by documenting some extreme views on the right during the Heartland institute’s international conference on climate change. The vehement denial of climate change is a display of the conservatives’ fear of shifting away from capitalist principles and the extravagant abuse of the Mother Earth. Climate change will indeed change everything. It will change the way we consume, we make money, and companies rely on oil/gas excavation/extraction will no longer be able to justify their damaging behaviour. Unfortunately, gradual change to our way of life can no longer save the planet from its eventual deterioration. Or rather, can save us from the inevitable destruction of global warming. The conservatives backed by big oil companies gathered at the Heartland convention to stop the inevitable shift in consumption and try to manipulate the public to allow the big oil companies to continue making money from putting our future in jeopardy. The truth is, a lot of people who were making an extravagant living off fossil fuels were deeply threatened by climate change. Their ideology that Earth was a source of unlimited provider of wealth was destroyed. The initial failure of most of the initiatives was caused by the difficulty addressing structural inequality and the resistance against socialism. They feared that upholding capitalism might not be feasible in the face of global warming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing the potential impact of climate change, The big oil companies and other energy players donate 900 million dollars every year to the Heartland institute and other climate denier think tank to prevent the final realization that their greed had taken our future away from us. Despite the looming danger of a warming world, politicians and corrupted scientists still claimed that global warming was a hoax. Some green activists chose to not confront the fervent fury of the climate deniers, trying to suggest the use of a technological solution. Unfortunately, high-tech solutions reinforced the idea of disaster capitalism and brought in extra emission while doing little to make a difference.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from all the deniers muddling up the water, the effort to make a difference has been thwarted by international trade law. Klein talked about the local green initiatives in Ontario, and how trade law had become an unbreakable barrier to meaningful climate change solutions. The dirtier global industrialization which required more transportation and energy waste was preferred to the cleaner local development. UN climate action failed to push for the mention of climate change in trade law led to the many failures of green energy implementation. At the same time, wealthy nations like the US could outsource the dirtiest part of industrialization to developing nations like China and India. Faced with financial needs and rapid development, developing worlds had to accept the self-destruction while becoming the scapegoat for the first world countries. As a result, there was seldom reduction in pollution internationally, while many skilled workers in wealthy nations struggled to find work, leading to nationalism and volatile societies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein proposed a series of methods to combat climate change: cheap public transit, clean light rail, and more housing along transit lines. Cities must be developed for high-density living. The development could benefit people living in poverty by providing more job and education opportunities. Besides supporting low-income communities, a luxury tax could be introduced to discourage non-necessity consumption. Implementing universal basic income could discourage wasteful consumption caused by low life quality such as impulsive shopping and encourage low carbon footprint activities such as gardening and cooking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond these methods, Klein pointed out the importance of publicizing power infrastructure. A small town in Germany in Hamburg was the example Klein used to amplify the benefits of public power ownership. Hamburg implemented clean power through public ownership and reversing private power grid. As Klein pointed out, private companies put their profits first, and would not make a significant shift to clean power willingly until every last dirty penny had been in their pockets. By making energy a part of the community’s concern, people would feel compelled to make a more sustainable decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein then indicated that it is undeniable that the increasing frequency of disasters all around the world had increase inequalities among communities. Public funding must prepare for worse climate conditions to come. To support this spending, fossil fuel companies would be heavily taxes for exchanging our future for profits. Many researches had demonstrated that by taxing the oil companies, we would have more than enough to foster a sustainable infrastructure. To rely on private companies to provide and provision power was foolish. A brand-new way to institute decentralized power locally and publicly must be adopted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein hinted that the public held the power to stop damaging and irreversible climate decisions, as the Keystone XL project demonstrated. Without regulations limiting what energy companies could and could not do, our climate future seemed dire. As more resistance came to traditional fossil fuel consumption, dirty innovations such as shale gas and fracking had came to existence. Unfortunately, these unconventional energy sources had proven to be more expensive and dirtier to extract, and they produced equally hefty carbon footprints.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make a difference that has lasting effect, we must look to the connections we have with Earth. Klein used the failure of Nauru to outline the danger of excusing treating the Earth with violence in the name of ecological growth. The invention of the steam engine had gave us the false sense of security that energy could be manipulated, while the truth was far from it. The attempted control of nature was arrogate and foolish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journey to a better relationship with earth seemed to be faced with challenges from compromises and alternative solutions. Even many of the environmental groups like the Nature Conservancy defined climate activism narrowly and accepted donation from major polluters in the name of allyship. It even went as far as performing its own gas extraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some others who want to combat climate change came up with ecological solutions like the carbon tax, yet unethical clever player in the climate game took advantage of any potential flaw. Setting fire to natural gas because it was cheaper, using high emission technology to destroy by-product, and marking nature reserves as a business to sell carbon credits and provide offsets for energy companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green billionaires like Richard Branson vowed to donate billions to groundbreaking solutions, yet the promises had not been met. The technical solutions were nothing more than disappointment. As business owner themselves, they continued to pollute the Earth while being hailed as heroes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radical measures such as dimming the sun were even proposed. Klein warned that the atmosphere continued to be a mysterious presence. Such permanent alteration of the climate could lead to unexpected and catastrophic consequences. Geoengineering had done little but delaying real changes that could save us from foreseeable disasters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the grim prospect on climate groups and innovation gurus, Klein didn’t forget to remind us of the positive outlook for the climate problems. Blockadia described activist groups who hid in plain sight, united by resistance to mining and energy companies. They had achieved success all around the world like no other activism. They showed up in Greece, Canada, US, UK, and any other places where energy companies dared to set foot. Communities linked arms and fought against threats to their nature resources. They had delivered the most success seen in decades.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another tactics brewing success was the divestment movement. By calling on universities, governments, and organizations to discontinue their financial holding in all fossil companies, the movement put pressures on fossil companies and marked them as undesirable and illegitimate like the tobacco companies. In the court of public opinion, fossil fuel companies had lost their standings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the most fervent participants of Blockadia were indigenous communities, who traditionally held sustainability near and dear to their hearts. Their opposition to energy companies, however, had furthered their economical disadvantage. Many of them struggled to find employment after being passed on by energy companies. Instead of giving in, Blockadia movement had found alternatives. While faced with Economical challenges, indigenous communities educated members on building houses with insulation and provided youth with better opportunities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While celebrating our success so far, Klein didn&amp;rsquo;t forget to propose a global feed-in tariff. First world countries with high emission should compensate low-pollution developing countries that were faced with harsher environmental challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To close up the book, Klein intimately shared details of her infertility struggle. She drew the connections between pollutions and infertility, the Mother Earth and her own body, her child and baby animals. More than 3 quarters of the chemical was never tested for children. Dramatic decrease in birth and survival rate in different animals mark troubles from excavation failure, global warming, and ocean acidification. At the end, she called for an introspection on our relationship with the Mother Earth, and called for the reproductive rights for the planet as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, I have learned a lot about climate change from this book. Though I had been avoiding this topic for a long time, I am now feeling more connected to the issues facing Mother Earth than ever. One action that really resonated with me was when Klein mentioned that the transition to EV and other renewable energy sources would only be a temporary solution. The most effective strategy lies behind developing a new understanding of consumption, building cities fit for high-density living, and taxing the oil companies. There is a culture in today’s capitalist society to consume in more ways than you can imagine. Almost every new technical advancement focuses on how to take users’ data and encourage more consumption. The entire capitalist ecosystem banks on people to spend more to sustain its unsustainable design. At the same time, our Mother Earth is dying for the same consumption ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Klein was right. Climate change will change everything if we want to survive. Our fundamental belief in the capitalist infrastructure must be mended or abandoned to save ourselves before it is too late. As progressives, we must fight harder than the republicans and those who profit from extravagant spending to defeat the climate deniers and the powerful fossil fuel companies. The first step to this journey is to educate ourselves on the influence fossil fuel consumption has on our daily life and how much the capitalist spending habits have damaged our environment. If you have been hesitant to get involved with climate issues, this book is a great starter kit for you to become more aware and comfortable when it comes to climate change. The only way to ensure we are not robbing our grandkids of a future filled with beautiful animals and stunning landscape is to act now. Only collectively we can pressure the leaders of the world for more effective legislation and fair taxation of the rich.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection on the Attention Merchants</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/reflection-attention-merchants/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 18:04:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/reflection-attention-merchants/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/reflection-attention-merchants/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Reflection on the Attention Merchants" />&lt;p>Attention merchants are everywhere, dominating our lives. Here I am, starting my first unplugging ever. Social media, reality TV, and quick mobile game have been deterring me from focusing on my job and people around me. The habitual scrolling or the constant blaring of taboo-filled TV shows are indicators that I have been making a deal with the devil/attention merchants. I have never been one to have set a clear boundary between the internet and I. My friends know me to reply instantly and always be overshare my daily life on social media with no hesitation. This book The Attention Merchants has made me become more aware of how my attentions have been stolen and exchanged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book started with an introduction detailing a company named EFP that exchanged students’ attentions for funding for the school board. Essentially, the board entered the agreement to sell students’ attentions in exchange of free money, and corporations could then influence students’ awareness of the brands and establish life-long purchase habits. This real-life story reminds me of one episode of Daria, where the principal brought advertisements into the school for additional funding. The principal avoided scrutiny by hosting a community meeting during the Super Bowls. Even after Daria successfully exposed the principal for the reckless money grabber she was, we saw Daria and Jane walked out of the school building covered in Ultra Cola ads. Jane looked at Daria and declared success sarcastically since the ads could only be displayed outside of school. That storyline is incredibly similar to that of this book and every attention revolution. When a new form of attention merchants emerge, people usually are oblivious. Then they become outraged once these merchants’ evil practices have been exposed. Eventually, the attention merchants provide enough convenience for the users that people just sit there and accept them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Wu painted this egregious picture of improper marketing practice, he introduced us to the first attention merchant. Benjamin Day, a print shop proprietor, decided to include advertising in newspapers to reduce cost. His newspaper, the &lt;em>New York Sun&lt;/em>, became the leading paper in a year solely relying on taboos and its low cost. His practice started a new category of news coverage that used attention grabbing as its main concern. In 1835, the Sun convinced most people that there were little creatures on the moon.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu then introduced the first cultural revolt against the attention merchants. The invention of Jule Chéret , the advertising posters, took over the streets of Paris and started to become an assault on everyone’s eyeballs. This intrusion of attention harvesting eventually led to the anti-poster movement and limited the poster spread. There was something deeper behind simply aesthetic concerns. The awareness of one’s attention being exchanged for financial gains without one’s consent is the ultimate insult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The industry that became the likely representation of attention merchants turned out to be patent medicine, any sorts of natural healing products that provided nothing of scientific evidence. Claude Hopkins led the campaign to oversell these products and bring the manufacturer a large sum of money, while the actual ingredients of these products had no real medical benefits and were actually toxic. When you find pamphlets from random stores in your mailbox, you have Hopkins to thank! He invented “direct mailing”. When the patent medicine empire of Hopkins was just starting to grow, Samuel Adams, a former crime reporter, exposed the truth behind these products. To the consumer’s shock, some products contained sulphuric acid and the lab testing on animals had led to fatality. FDA was established as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu then described the marketing strategies used by royalty. During the First World War, Lord Kitchener recruited soldiers and inspired the iconic “Uncle Sam”. His fingers pointed to whoever was reading the poster with the caption “Your country needs YOU”. The British invented the war propaganda and would subsequently become the inspiration of the Soviet Union, communist China, and Nazi Germany. America was the next to follow in the political propaganda. George Creel, an assistant to Woodrow Wilson’s campaign, convinced the Americans that going to war was the patriotic choice and spread nationalist propaganda. The ordinary people were giving pro-war speeches, and propaganda films were produced. Uncle Sam came out during this time as well. People who were anti-war were arrested under the Espionage Act. The propaganda of the British and American filled some journalists with dismay, but some paid attention to the effectiveness of total government campaigns. Among those was Hitler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu introduced Scientific Advertising, a term included demand engineering, branding, and targeted advertisements. This scientific approach took over the advertising world. The predominant figure in this era was surprisingly once again Hopkins, who came out of his retirement. Products now utilized fear campaign, Freud’s unconsciousness, and results of different experiments. Brands now were associated with more than products, but an identity. Soon after, the men in advertising realized that women were often the missing targets of the market. Helen Landsowne, a female advertiser, used the common desire of women to be beautiful and implied that a product had the potential to lead to a better life. In the meantime, some products used fear to create market demands, some products associated themselves with political movements and traits consumers identified with, and some products used Celebrity endorsement as a new force in advertising. During this era, advertiser became smarter and sneakier, using a wide range of tools to capture attention of those who were missed with the initial strategy.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu then illustrated the stories of the &lt;em>Lucky Strike&lt;/em>. The success of its branding started with the false claim of the health benefits of &lt;em>Lucky strike&lt;/em> cigarettes and the “toasting” process. The classic doctor endorsement appeared in their advertisement. To get women to smoke, they framed smoking as an act of feminist freedom and acclaimed smoking as a weight-loss treatment. Quite despicable, but it worked wonders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon came the consumer movement, incited by the manifesto &lt;em>Your Money’s Worth&lt;/em>. Many former copywriters described the evil practices of advertising after the exposé. Along with the financial burdens caused by the Depression, Americans became angry towards the attention merchants. Advertisement should distribute information for the consumers, but based on these articles, these attention merchants had disobeyed the rule of the free market. An economist, Edward Chamberlin, criticized brand loyalty. As a result, FTC regained its power and oversaw advertising practices. The attention merchants, though weakened, had not had their last laughs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu started the next chapter, introducing the radio. Radio advertising had emerged as a new form of attention capturing technique. The hit radio show &lt;em>Amos n Andy&lt;/em> became the first prime-time show, with Pepsodent, a failing toothpaste company, as the sponsor. As the show became the most popular show, even to this day, NBC learned that they can “sell eyeballs”, Pepsodent’s sale increased more than two folds, and an industry found out that they could own a part of the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To compete with NBC, The CBS president, Paley decided CBS would provide content for free in exchange for sponsored content. Paley discovered Orson Welles and other talents, but he also remembered to set a limit on its advertising to keep CBS interesting and critics-free. CBS was also the first network to hire its own reporters. To prove to sponsors that their generosity had indeed made a difference in their sales, the &lt;em>Audimeter&lt;/em>, the early form of the Nielson box, was invented.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the time has come to talk about one of the most predominant and notorious attention merchants. Adolf Hitler reintroduced the standing German army after the last notes of Beethoven’s Symphony. Hitler learned from the best: the British propaganda in the First World War. He understood the only way to break the German’s objectivity was to tend to the less educated masses. As a former ads man, he suggested that propaganda had an important goal to attract attention. To suit the message to the “the great mass”, the message must be simple and resolved to slogans and small words. He knew emotions were more welcomed than persuasion, and crowd psychology moved even those who were intelligent. Other than the fact that he was already naturally blessed with an enunciation and charisma beyond any men, the radio played a crucial role in Hitler’s domination. The propaganda took over all air time as the more German started to listen to the radio. Opposed to the advertisers, instead of informing people of their choices, Hitler took away people’s freedom to observe other opinions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the war ended, televisions took over America by storm. &lt;em>I love Lucy&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Ed Sullivan Show&lt;/em> took CBS over the edge. TV advertisement was the next to follow, with Kellogg, Cadillac, Marlboro leading the trend. Warm association added an extra layer of attraction for company branding. Soon, 6he Competition between NBC and CBS brought quiz shows to drew audiences. Attention merchants like pain relievers and Crest did not miss the advertising break during these attention-grabbing shows to demonstrate their brand superiority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time of TV show prosperity came a second attention revolt. This time around, it was the invention of remote controls. Remote controls gave the audience the freedom to move their attention away from the ads and to freely choose something more entertaining. Ads were revealed to be extremely effective when it came to attention manipulation, and game shows were exposed to be staged for dramatic effects. These scandals eventually led to the 60s attention revolt. Timothy Leary, a former Harvard professor, led the Great Refusal by following the most revolutionary American slogans and invented “Turn on, Tune in, Drop out”. To his surprise, as he appropriated the advertisers’ tactics, the advertisers similarly used his cause for their purpose. Pepsi, hoping to end their underdog journey, identified themselves with the attention revolt. They became the representation of youth, individualism, and anti-establishment. Against Coke’s all-American brand association, Pepsi started to close the gap slowly. During the same era, the attention merchants turned themselves to the children. Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, and Charlie Brown captured Children’s attention. New advertisers associated brands with social issues that were the centre of conversations such as the second-wave feminism. Unfortunately for the resistance, capitalism had and continued to be known to be resilient and adaptable. Capitalism in the 70s wrote individualism and freedom into its playbook, continuing to deny a simple way of living to Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To distribute advertisements more efficiently, a former New York University professor, Robbin, developed computer models PRIZM (Potential Ratings in ZIP Markets) and sorted the US into clusters with different shopping habits and living conditions. Based on the cluster a household is in, advertisers sent out pamphlets and produced billboards based on their profiles. Cable networks targeting each cluster started to pop out, ESPN, BET, and Bravo. Fox News also started as a target network for conservative viewers. With the increasing numbers of TV channels, channel surfing had emerged as an unintended consequence, producing inattentive scattered viewers. Commercials learned about celebrity endorsement. Super Bowl became a spectacle. The great refusal ended with a whimper, leading to a more capable and effective attention economy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, Wu covered the appearance of the third screen - the computer screen. The email was invented and saved the internet from a premature death. The check-in ritual, habitual checking of your digital mailbox to see if there was any new email, would eventually become the mode of attention capturing for all social media. The first spam mail was a several-page long invitation to an event. Though even the Pentagon was furious with the spam mail, trolling and spamming never truly stopped after that.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The potential of computer for personal entertainment was soon discovered. The arcade game &lt;em>Space Invaders&lt;/em> took over the world by storm. A new model, cash for experience, was invented. The urge to complete against others made the game an addiction. To win over women and girls, &lt;em>Pac-Man&lt;/em> then became a social craze. To encourage more casual use of the internet, four companies competed for dominance in the computer network. These subscription based services offered access to then-government-owned internet with a small selection of online spaces. AOL used communities to entertain themselves. Despite the lack of funding compared to all other companies, AOL came up with a strategy, to make its space happy and friendly. It’s infamous chat rooms allowed private rooms, which eventually evolved into sex-related flirtation. Prodigy, one of the other companies, implemented a profanity ban in its chat rooms as they tried to keep the chat rooms pristine. The Draconian method to online speech eventually attracted more users to AOL. With 4 million users, AOL came out in front. To continue its growth, AOL offered advertisement rights to companies. These companies engaged in bidding wars to be able to advertise their products in AOL. The dawn of the internet started as an intense war zone, but the competition certainly did not stop here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Internet was still in its cradle stage, the entertainment industry was evolving in the speed of lightening. Celebrity power was harnessed to strengthen attention merchants’ hold on the mass. &lt;em>Times&lt;/em> and &lt;em>People&lt;/em> filled their pages with celebrity gossips and personality stories. For any platform invented after, celebrities became the attention merchants’ first bait, luring people in. For example, the celebrity-focused television,
Oprah’s show became a huge success through combining entertainment with her supportive discussion, the fascinating cuisine, and her spiritual/religious objectives. Even with more competition, Oprah stayed on top. Her personal growth theory encouraged consumption, and a single sentence of endorsement booked $90,000 in a single afternoon. The Oprah empire was soon established from the audiences&amp;rsquo; frenzy. Though eventually the rating of her show dropped due to her endorsement of the law of attraction, and her TV channel drowned into the hundreds of channels now on TV, her rise to fame did inspire many other shows like Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray, and other product endorsement focused celebrity shows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reality TV was soon invented by MTV. Despite the initial backlash, reality shows proved themselves to be cheaper to produce and sometimes more attention capturing compared to TV shows. Reality TV shows appealed to the mass and promised celebrity and fame to the ordinary people. This promise produced a sustainable economy similar to the capitalism‘a promise of richness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the internet finally became a free and unlimited space for everyone to enjoy, Google, with its clean algorithms and limited ads interface, started to attract users. To sustain its growth, instead of delivering ads that were purely distracting, Google designed targeted ads that added values to the customer’s experience. Using AdWords (now known as Google Ads), Google became the most profitable attention merchant. Blogging became a trend among internet users. The sharing of a blog became a new way to harvest attention. YouTube as a form of self-expression attracted amateurs, professionals, and commercial content. The Huffington Post was established as a prime utiliser of the clickbait.
Young Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook with his determination to prove that he was the better developer. Turned out that people loved sharing personal details and experience online. It surpassed MySpace because of its control of page design and proper control of certain content. It took over the social media world because of its stability and usability. Though Facebook could not conveniently insert ads like Google, it eventually found other ways to demonstrate its advertising value. Its like buttons tracked people’s preference so appropriate ads could be shown to its users. The beauty of social media proved to be attractive in a Skinneresque manner. Though most content was disappointing, the occasional rewards kept people coming back for more. At the same time, Twitter provided a platform for everyone to share their everyday thoughts casually. The invention of followers conveniently pushed interesting content to everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the competition among social media sites were heating up, phone arrived as the fourth screen thanks to the Canadian company BlackBerry. While different mobile games were trending, Instagram appeared as a picture-centric social media application. Successful attention merchants like the Kardashian utilized this new media to resell attention and amounted to millions of dollars.&lt;br>
Netflix became a successful attention merchant without an ad-centric approach. The word “binge-watching” was included in the dictionary thanks to Netflix’s rise to popularity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the other tech companies indulged in attention resale and privacy erosion. Apple decided that they would choose privacy of their customers as their priorities. Apple implemented tracker and ads blockers, infuriated attention merchants like Mark Zuckerberg. This act of privacy protection also put Android in peril, since Google had chosen the attention model of operation, making it difficult for Android to come out on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu concluded that we may never fully get rid of attention merchants. Ultimately, advertisements served as informative tools for the consumers. Yet, there had been too little regulations imposed on how intrusive these attention merchants could be. With the convenience and entertain under our fingertips, we, in exchange, had our privacy eroded by attention merchants. These attention merchants are intruders in our daily lives. Without our consent, these merchants took away our privacy and occupied our freedom in exchange for free or cheap entertainment. Wu encouraged us to reclaim our time and emphasized the damage it may have on society if most of our attention was spent unfocused and scattered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His call to action did give me the idea for starting the unplugging. The book comprehensively described the evolution of attention merchants and highlighted different strategies to capture attention. We have long been warned that social media like Instagram and Facebook have negative effects on our mental health. Companies use ads to create unnecessary demands and use social issues to raise brand awareness. We are constantly distracted by different attention merchants craving for our attentions. Short videos on popular platforms like TikTok and Instagram reduced our attention span to quick burst of interesting moments. With the rising popularity of different streaming platform, we no longer carefully analyze the shows we watch. Instead, we binge through multiple shows a week. Crazy enough, some platforms invite us to watch shows with two times the speed. Everything in our life exist with the secondary purpose to resell our attention. Research in computer science and data science is focusing on distributing ads more efficiently. The world exists in serving the capitalist purpose to gain more profits for the attention merchants. I miss the days before the internet and phones, when we spent time outdoors and read a lot more. I miss the days before social media commercialization where we simply went online for socialization and not scrolling through pages of advertisements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to live like that again, authentic and pure, stress-free yet purposeful. Even if I do wish to exchange my attention for entertainment or convenience, it better be a thoughtful and relaxing experience with my full consent, rather than the 50-page privacy agreement the companies are pushing onto us. It is the time to call for another attention revolt, even if it’s one that only involves one person, you. I refuse to let attention merchants occupy my thoughts. My thoughts that are better spent on the real, touchable beauty in the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection on "Capitalist Realism"</title><link>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 16:56:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://zhoudoris13.github.io/p/capitalist-realism/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Reflection on "Capitalist Realism"" />&lt;p>As a Bernie bro turned half-closeted anti-capitalist, I am slightly embarrassed to admit that this book is the first book I’ve read that goes in-depth explaining capitalism. Life in engineering has completely devoid me of any free time to sit down and read. This free time after graduation becomes the first time in a long while that I could indulge my curiosity about late-term capitalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fisher started the book with the description of a vital scene in the movie &lt;em>Children of Men&lt;/em>. He then brought up the phrase:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In two pages, Fisher immediately captured the reader. It is undeniably true that often time in any discussion regarding anti-capitalism, a common response from the opposer is usually that though capitalism is evil, there is simply no other viable political and economical system. Thus, capitalist realism: the belief that capitalism is “real” and the only plausible social system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fisher then dived into a discussion about arts in the modern days and explained how hip-hop has gained increasing popularity. Fisher explained postmodernism briefly and pointed out that the current over-saturation of media is largely a phenomenon of late-capitalism: once a certain story/style has gained considerable popularity, artists/producers are reluctant to produce anything new. They reproduce the same storylines or music (if it ain’t broke and brings in profit, why fix it?). A prime example of this is the number of box office movies that fall into the “remake” genre.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next couple of chapters, Fisher declared that moral criticism of capitalism only reinforces capitalist realism. This discussion reminds me of what Jeremiah Whitewhale said in the TV show &lt;em>Bojack Horseman&lt;/em>, after Diane confronted him on his evil anti-labour practice. He claimed that when news about his company evil practices come out, people think the company is uncompromised by morality, the stock goes up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the stranglehold capitalist realism has exacted on most people, Fisher illuminated that the only way to dismantle capitalist realism is to point out the inconsistencies within the capitalist ideals. Besides the already contested climate change issue, Fisher emphasized two other areas of discussion - mental health and bureaucracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next chapter, Fisher discussed reflexive impotence and depressive hedonia. He had an intriguing proposition that the individualization of mental health problems - “treating them as if they were caused by chemical imbalances in the individual’s neurology and/or by their family background“ - took out the possibility of societal causation. He then explained depressive hedonia: the phenomenon where depression is the result of the constant craving for pleasure. I am by no means an expert in depression or any other mental illness, but I am reluctant to agree that what gives rise to depression is a societal one and not a chemical one. I would be more inclined to accept this proposition if there is more evidence that there is more than a correlation between mental health issues and the over-saturation of media. Though it is evident that the number of people with diagnosed mental health issue skyrocketed in the last decade, based on a press release by American Psychological Association (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/03/mental-health-adults" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mental Health Issues Increased Significantly in Young Adults Over Last Decade&lt;/a>), I attribute some of these effects to the developing and more comprehensive mental health support nowadays. These doubts aside, teens’ constant obsession over the “matrix” - as Fisher named the social media - harms their mental health. (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.statista.com/topics/9178/social-media-and-teenage-mental-health/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Social media and teenage mental health - Statistics and Facts&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Post-Fordism and the instability of the current workplace culture leak through workers’ workplaces and into their everyday lives. Due to the insepration between life and work, more workers suffer from mental distress. Without the assurance of job security, people are suffering from increasing stress. Yet, Fisher reminds us that capitalism denies any societal effects that may have led to this mental health endemic. At the same time, an abundance of wealth has been made by the pharmaceutical companies in the treatment of mental illness.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next chapter, Fisher discussed the bureaucracy stemming from capitalism. Though theoritically capitalism aims to eliminate the bureaucracy in Stalinism by making all processes transactional, bureaucracy exists in capitalism more consistently and less tangibly. For example, there is no formal review in the workplace, but many employees are asked to set goals and self-reflect. The phrase “work smarter, not harder” emphasizes the need for change and puts immense pressure on the employees to adapt to the ever-changing labour market. I have always demised when companies ask for employees with multi-skills while offering salaries that one can barely scrape by. The obnoxious discussion of “lifelong learning” and “key-shaped person” implies that to be successful, one must be ready to constantly adapt to new challenges and reshape oneself. This implication is an unfair request from the capitalist society to employees while not providing any security and stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the inconsistencies of mental health and bureaucracy in capitalism, Fisher expresses his belief that capitalist realism is a merely plastic reality that is reconfiguring itself constantly. Capitalism urges people to adapt to changes with ease. The strongest survivors of the capitalist society believe that nothing is constant but change. Due to the lack of a central exchange in a capitalist society, people largely overlook the capital or big corporations as the culprits for large-scale societal problems. For example, people largely blame the government for the 2008 financial crisis while the behaviour of capital plays an essential role. Capitalism tends to resolve problems by making them everyone&amp;rsquo;s problems. Fisher used recycling as an example. The responsibilization results in no one really taking care of the problem. I have always been angry at politicians who deflected by claiming battling climate change is everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility. These very same politicians have been accepting donations from big oil companies and caressed by climate change denying lobbiests. Despicable of them to shame us for driving to work/school under the underfunded public infratstructure, while allowing the large carbon producers roam free.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fisher ended the book with the forewarning that late-term capitalism may divert to social democracy or authoritarianism. He warned that any effective anti-capitalist social system must be a rival to capitalism and not a reaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I genuinely enjoyed this book. This book is one of the first pieces of literature I have touched on in a few years, and it resonated with a lot of my frustrations. As a newbie in the anti-capitalist world, this book is a fantastic introduction to and an engaging discussion of many facets of late-term capitalism. There are a lot of &amp;ldquo;Ah-ha&amp;rdquo; moments in this book, such as the phenomena of postmodernism, the instability in the post-Fordism era, the omnipresence of bureaucracy in the workplace, and the responsibilization of all world problems. When I was studying film, our screenwriting professor would tell us to only write stories with happy endings and follow the Hollywood plotline. Such misfortune in the artistic world is a reflection of late-term capitalism phenomena. I used to take pride in being very flexible, but now I am aware that this flexibility is a reaction to the ever-changing climate in the labour market. Being able to reflect on many aspects of my own life has been refreshing. I will revisit this book after reading more anti-capitalist/marxist literature to gain a clearer understanding of Fisher&amp;rsquo;s references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, an astonishingly positive experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
